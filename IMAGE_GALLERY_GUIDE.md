# Image Gallery Setup Guide

## How to Add Your Project Images

The gallery system is now clean and only shows actual uploaded project images. There are two main gallery areas:

### 1. Main Image Gallery (`/images`)
- **Purpose**: Showcase all your best project images in one place
- **Current Status**: Contains 4 uploaded AV installation images
- **File Location**: `/src/app/images/page.tsx`

### 2. Category Gallery Pages
- **Purpose**: Organize images by project type
- **Current Status**: All categories are empty except Tech & AV
- **Available Categories**:
  - `/gallery/tech-av` - Audio-visual installations (currently has 4 images)
  - `/gallery/acoustic-panels` - Acoustic panel installations (empty)
  - `/gallery/restaurants` - Restaurant projects (empty)
  - `/gallery/night-clubs` - Nightclub projects (empty)
  - `/gallery/schools-worship` - School and church projects (empty)
  - `/gallery/commercial-spaces` - Office and commercial projects (empty)
  - `/gallery/industrial-machinery` - Industrial noise control (empty)

## Step 1: Upload Images to Project Folders

1. **Choose the right category folder** in `/public/gallery/`:
   - `/public/gallery/tech-av/` - AV systems, DJ booths, sound equipment
   - `/public/gallery/acoustic-panels/` - Acoustic treatment panels
   - `/public/gallery/restaurants/` - Restaurant acoustic projects
   - `/public/gallery/night-clubs/` - Nightclub installations
   - `/public/gallery/schools-worship/` - Educational and religious facilities
   - `/public/gallery/commercial-spaces/` - Offices, meeting rooms, commercial
   - `/public/gallery/industrial-machinery/` - Factory noise control, machinery

2. **Image specifications:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Size: 800x600px (4:3 aspect ratio) recommended
   - File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading
   - Naming: Use descriptive names like `church-acoustic-panels.jpg`

## Step 2: Add Images to Gallery Arrays

### For Main Image Gallery (`/images` page):
Edit `/src/app/images/page.tsx` and add your images to the `galleryImages` array:

```typescript
const galleryImages = [
  // Existing AV images...
  {
    id: 5,
    src: '/gallery/restaurants/restaurant-acoustic-panels.jpg',
    title: 'Restaurant Acoustic Treatment',
    description: 'Elegant acoustic panels for noise control in dining areas'
  },
  // Add more images...
];
```

### For Category Gallery Pages:
Each category page has an empty array with instructions. For example, to add restaurant images:

1. **Open** `/src/app/gallery/restaurants/page.tsx`
2. **Replace the empty array** with your images:

```typescript
const galleryImages: GalleryImage[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    src: '/gallery/restaurants/fine-dining-treatment.jpg',
    title: 'Fine Dining Acoustic Treatment',
    description: 'Professional acoustic panels for upscale restaurant'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    src: '/gallery/restaurants/cafe-sound-control.jpg',
    title: 'Cafe Sound Control',
    description: 'Decorative acoustic solutions for cafe environment'
  }
];
```

const galleryImages: GalleryImage[] = [
  // Upload your images to /public/gallery/[category]/ and add them here:
  // Example:
  // {
  //   id: 1,
  //   src: '/gallery/[category]/your-image.jpg',
  //   title: 'Your Project Title',
  //   description: 'Description of your project'
  // }
];
```

Simply replace the commented example with your actual project data.
